# Project Topic:  Palmoria Group HR Analysis

### üß† Project Overview
Palmoria Group, a manufacturing giant in Nigeria, is under fire over gender imbalance across its three operating regions. With public perception and future expansion at risk, HR Analytics was activated to address the issue head-on.

### üìÇ Data Source
The dataset used in this project was provided directly by the Human Resources department of Palmoria Group. It contains employee-level records including employee names, gender, department, location, rating and salary information across the company‚Äôs three operational zones in Nigeria.

### üéØ Objective
Investigate workforce gender distribution across regions and departments, identify gaps, and support leadership in fostering inclusion.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Methods
- SQL: Data cleansing (e.g., null gender/department fix), structure transformations, and aggregation queries

- Power BI: Interactive dashboards using slicers (Region, Department), gender breakdowns, and trend insights

### üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation
Before analysis could begin, significant preprocessing was required to ensure data quality, consistency, and accuracy. The following steps were carried out:
1. Standardizing Column Names
Renamed location column to region for clarity and alignment with business terminology.
2. Addressed missing entries in gender and department using:
- Default imputation for key fields
- Manual corrections from known HR records.
3. Uniform Data Formatting
- Salary, rating, and bonus fields converted to proper number formats
- Categorical entries (e.g., performance ratings, departments) standardized to eliminate typos or mismatched spelling.
4. Bonus Rule Integration
- Linked the bonus percentage matrix from your Excel file into Power BI and SQL queries
-Prepared dynamic lookups to calculate bonuses based on department + performance rating.
